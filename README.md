## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot about structuring React code into components using props and also used Hooks to manage the state of the application. I also learned about using CSS Grid to layout the page.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}
```
